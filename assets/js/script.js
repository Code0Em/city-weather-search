// **JAVASCRIPT TASKS**
// TASK 1: Get API key from OpenWeatherMap API and construct API url. End point will be the city name (i.e. user’s input and/or input saved to the browser). Also add parameters for units in metric.

// TASK 2: Create a function which “fetches” the city’s data from the API, when the user inputs the city and selects the search button. Within this, use an if/else statement to validate the user’s input and display an error message if the input’s blank.

// TASK 3: Create a function which displays today’s forecast for the city, and stores the city’s name to the browser.

// TASK 4: Create a function which displays the next five days’ forecast for the city.

// TASK 5: Create a function which “collects” the innerHTML of the search history buttons (i.e. so we can then check if a button for the city already exists).

// TASK 6: Create a function which creates a new search history button, if there is not one already created for the city.

// TASK 6: Create a function which retrieves the city’s name from the browser and “fetches” the city’s data from the API (i.e. so that the data is up to date), when the user selects the city’s search history button.

// TASK 7: Create a function which clears any stored city names from the browser and removes any search history buttons from the page, when the user selects the clear button.
